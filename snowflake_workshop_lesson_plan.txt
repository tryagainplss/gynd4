• Implement role-based access control through views

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

SLIDE 4: VIEWS FUNDAMENTALS
---------------------------
• Regular Views: Virtual tables based on SELECT statements
• Materialized Views: Pre-computed results stored physically
• Benefits: Query simplification, security, performance
• Use Cases: Data abstraction, access control, performance optimization

SLIDE 5: TELCO VIEWS USE CASES
------------------------------
• Call Detail Records (CDR) aggregation views
• Network performance monitoring views

SLIDE 8: MODULE 2: TIME TRAVEL & FAIL-SAFE
------------------------------------------
Learning Objective:
• Implement data recovery and audit capabilities using Snowflake's Time Travel and Fail-safe features

Key Concepts:
• Time Travel: Point-in-time data recovery (up to 90 days)
• Fail-safe: 7-day emergency backup after Time Travel expires
• Data retention policies and configuration
